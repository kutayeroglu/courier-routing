# Take action and return the next state and reward
def take_action(courier, action, order_list, m=5):
    '''
    Description from paper:

    === Move ===
    * Each move action results in a reward of âˆ’ 1 if an order is assigned to the courier
        * -0.1 otherwise.

    === Pick-up & Deliver ===
    * Couriers receive a positive reward for each successful pick-up and deliver
        actions. This reward is proportional to the grid size and adjusted to the
        total number of grids.

    * A penalty is incurred if the courier takes illegal pick-up and deliver actions.
        This penalty is also proportional to the grid size and adjusted to the total
        number of grids.
        * Note that illegal pick-up is defined as taking a pick-up action while there
        is no order in the courier location index. In addition, illegal deliver
        action may include the following situations:
            * taking a deliver action while there is no order with the courier
            * the courier location is not equal to destination.

    === Stay ===
    * If a courier takes a stay action, then no reward is received. However if
    a courier takes a stay action when an order is assigned to him, then a
    penalty is incurred, which is equal to the grid size.

    === Reject ===
    * Reject action also results in a negative reward. If the courier rejects an
    order while delivering it, a penalty is received, which is equal to the grid
    size.
        * On the other hand, if the courier rejects an order right after the order
        is assigned to it, then it receives a smaller penalty.

    === Timeout ===
    * It is also important to account for the timed-out orders in the environment,
    which might be byproduct of reject actions or having insufficient number of
    couriers.
        * In particular, if an order is not assigned to a courier within a predefined
        amount of time, then the order leaves the system and a penalty is incurred
        for each such order.
