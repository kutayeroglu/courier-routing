  Description from paper:

  === Move ===
  * Each move action results in a reward of âˆ’ 1 if an order is assigned to the courier
      * -0.1 otherwise.

  === Pick-up & Deliver ===
  * Couriers receive a positive reward for each successful pick-up and deliver
    actions. This reward is proportional to the grid size and adjusted to the
    total number of grids.

  * A penalty is incurred if the courier takes illegal pick-up and deliver actions.
    This penalty is also proportional to the grid size and adjusted to the total
    number of grids.
      * Note that illegal pick-up is defined as taking a pick-up action while there
      is no order in the courier location index. In addition, illegal deliver
      action may include the following situations:
        * taking a deliver action while there is no order with the courier
        * the courier location is not equal to destination.

  === Stay ===
  * If a courier takes a stay action, then no reward is received. However if
  a courier takes a stay action when an order is assigned to him, then a
  penalty is incurred, which is equal to the grid size.

  === Reject ===
  * Reject action also results in a negative reward. If the courier rejects an
  order while delivering it, a penalty is received, which is equal to the grid
  size.
    * On the other hand, if the courier rejects an order right after the order
    is assigned to it, then it receives a smaller penalty.

  === Timeout ===
  * It is also important to account for the timed-out orders in the environment,
   which might be byproduct of reject actions or having insufficient number of
   couriers.
    * In particular, if an order is not assigned to a courier within a predefined
    amount of time, then the order leaves the system and a penalty is incurred
    for each such order.
